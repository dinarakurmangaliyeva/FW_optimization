# Optimization Project: Frank-Wolfe Algorithms for the Max-Clique Problem

This repository contains files related to the implementation and analysis of optimization algorithms applied to the L2-regularized Max-Clique problem. The project compares the classic Frank-Wolfe algorithm with its advanced variantsâ€”Pairwise Frank-Wolfe and Away-Step Frank-Wolfe.

## Files Included

1. **Optimization_project.ipynb**  
   A Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the Frank-Wolfe algorithms and their variants, along with performance analysis on selected datasets.

2. **Optimization project.pdf**  
   The final project report documenting the methodology, literature review, results, and conclusions from the analysis of the algorithms.

## Project Highlights

- **Goal:** Analyze the efficiency and convergence properties of Frank-Wolfe algorithms in solving the Max-Clique problem.
- **Datasets:** Experiments conducted on C125.9, DSJC500_5, and Keller6 datasets from the DIMACS benchmark suite.
- **Results:** Pairwise Frank-Wolfe, particularly with the Armijo rule, demonstrated superior performance in terms of convergence and computational efficiency.
